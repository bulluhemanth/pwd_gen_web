# pwd_gen_web
This is version 1.0 of one of the projects I am passionate about, That's password generation.

My Motive behind doing this project is i can only come up with many passwords with the limited birthdays/Life events/ People's names I can remember and think of.

Currently All the web app is front end 

Tech stack being used

#HTML
#CSS
#javaScript


Also I might've copied the code from somewhere and merged it really sloppy. But that's what engineering is right? Combining the concepts you know and build something?
